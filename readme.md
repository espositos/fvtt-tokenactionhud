# Token Action HUD
This module populates a repositionable HUD showing the most common basic actions for a selected token. Currently the HUD supports DND5e, WFRP4e, Dungeon World, Pathfinder 2E, Pathfinder 1E, Star Wars FFG, Star Wars 5e, Shadow of the Demonlord (thanks to Xacus#7239) and SFRPG (thanks to Rainer#5041).

4. Within the game, click on **Settings** -> **Manage Modules** and make sure the Token Action Hud is enabled.

Once activated, selecting a token that has an actor/character sheet associated with it and that you have permission to control should display an an action bar that is populated with the actions and abilities available for that token. The HUD can be disabled on a per-user basis if so desired.
