## [0.2.5] 2020-06-28
### Added
- PF2E: Added first stage of implementation for Pathfinder 2E. A lot of things aren't implemented in PF2E yet, so this isn't quite as feature-rich as DND5e.

## [0.2.4] 2020-06-26
### Bugfix
- DND5e: all BetterRoll weapon attacks were going through rollItem not quickRoll, but only a right-click versatile attack should go via rollItem.

## [0.2.3] 2020-06-26

- DND5e: Pact slots weren't being shared with other spell levels or vice-versa

### Changed

- DND5e: Renamed Ability Tests to Ability Checks.

## [0.2.0] 2020-06-25
### Added
- DND5e: add choice of showing all nonprepared spells (innate, pact, at-will, always prepared), or hiding based on their 'prepared'-ness.

## [0.1.20] 2020-06-25
### Bugfix
- Choice of roll handler was not sticking due to some poor logic.

### Changed
- Added some shadows to info fields on categories to make them more visible against similarly coloured backgrounds.

## [0.1.19] 2020-06-24

- Default to the core role handler for each system if the third-party module is unavailable.

- DND5e: Don't display items with no quantity.

### Changed
- Tried to remove some unnecessary logging when debug mode enabled.
- Removed some cruft.

## [0.1.18] 2020-06-22
### Added
- DND5e - the order of feats and items now follows their draggable order in the inventory.

### Changed
- CSS - changed appearance of info next to subcategory name (currently only used to indicate spell slots).
- DND5e - spells should now be sorted by level and then alphabetically.

## [0.1.17] 2020-06-21
### Added
- MinorQOL & BetterRolls - added ability to right click weapons for versatile attack when one exists (right-click acts as normal click if item has no versatile property). Has a slight problem with BetterRolls which uses shift for advantage, because shift right click is hardcoded to bring up the context menu in some browsers, but I don't want to mess with BR's shift/ctrl/alt preferences.

### Changed
- Renamed some CSS classes because they were really long.
- Renamed consumables without charges to 'incomsumables'.
- Filtered consumables of type 'ammo' out of list, but their count should show in curly braces when assigned to a weapon.

## [0.1.16] 2020-06-20
### Changed
- Updated CSS for buttons because they were being overridden by the Alt5e sheet.

## [0.1.15] 2020-06-20
### Added
- Agnostic - basic hovering, adapted from Token Tooltip, borrowed from Kekilla's issues tracking
- DND5e - ability to abbreviate skills and abilities, suggested by Tercept
- DND5e - option to separate ability tests and saves, suggested by Tercept
- Changelog, we'll see how long I keep this up.
- Updated readme

### Changed
- DND5e roll handlers now extend the core DND5e roll handler rather than the base class
